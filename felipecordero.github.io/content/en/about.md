intro: >-
  I’m Seamus Barcoe, a Technical Support Engineer and Systems Support Analyst 💻☁️ with 10+ years of experience supporting large-scale enterprise environments across VMware, AWS, Linux, and complex application and database troubleshooting. I began my career at VMware supporting vSphere production environments, then moved to Wells Fargo where I supported VMware infrastructure at massive scale, helping maintain high availability across 100,000+ VMs and 5,000+ ESXi hosts. I later worked at ScienceLogic as a Tier 2 escalation engineer for the SL1 monitoring platform, partnering closely with Engineering and R&D on high-priority issues. At ServiceNow, I focused on platform performance and reliability, including deep troubleshooting across MariaDB and full-stack diagnostics using observability tooling.

  Most recently, I supported Broadcom’s VMware Cloud on AWS at HCLTech, delivering advanced troubleshooting across VMC, vSphere, ESXi, and Aria, with a strong emphasis on incident ownership, root cause analysis, and customer outcomes.

passion_text: >-
  I focus on solving complex infrastructure problems in production. This includes VMware and cloud troubleshooting, performance analysis using tools like Splunk and Grafana, and structured debugging across Linux, storage, and database-backed platforms. I also enjoy building small internal tools that remove friction from support workflows. For example, I’ve developed and contributed to Tampermonkey and Salesforce workflow enhancements that improved team efficiency and increased case closure performance.

  With experience across VMware, financial services infrastructure, monitoring platforms, and enterprise SaaS, I bring a pragmatic approach to troubleshooting. I work well across escalations, on-call environments, and cross-functional collaboration with Engineering and R&D, always aiming for clear diagnosis, reproducible findings, and durable fixes.
